We believe that is what it takes to identify powerful trends, recognize visionary innovators, collaborate effectively, and make transformative investments.

We believe that is what it takes to build exceptional businesses.

We’ve spent decades traveling the world – observing, listening, participating, experimenting… We’ve studied consumers. Honed our perspective. Identified trends. Recognized disruptors. Conducted analysis. Invested in and operated businesses. Built brands.

Along the way, we’ve learned a lot, especially the importance of credibility and trust.

We’ve been involved in operating and investing at all stages of development – from seeding ideas to creating unicorns to taking companies public. We’ve worked alongside public company CEOs and management teams to tackle pivotal changes in consumer trends and develop powerful global strategies. We’ve seen success and failure, examined the post-mortems, and tried to learn from both.

Most importantly, we know the learning is never done.

We know how hard it is to build a sustainable, profitable business. We created Clerisy to partner with founders, share our experience, perspective and expertise, and deliver resources that can drive growth and help build extraordinary businesses.

Lisa lived in the global public equity markets for almost 20 years as a portfolio manager, and coordinator of all consumer research for Templeton. She looped the globe observing consumers, identifying secular and structural trends, meeting with companies of all sizes and shapes, and strategizing with the management teams of those companies. After almost two decades, Lisa decided it was time to roll up her sleeves for real. She spent a year doing some hybrid investing in public and private companies with BTG Pactual, and ultimately joined LCatterton as a partner on their flagship Buyout Fund. As L Catterton was growing bigger, Lisa found herself drawn to the challenges of earlier stage companies. Convinced that her cumulative perspective, and broad global experience and network could be most impactful to founders searching for partners to help them scale and grow their businesses, Lisa convinced Alexandra to build Clerisy with her as a purpose-built platform to help accelerate the building of amazing, sustainable, profitable businesses. While Lisa hails from the northeast, where she attended U Penn, and Georgetown for her law degree, Lisa has called The Bahamas home for over 25 years. When Lisa is not doing a deep dive into company strategy, she can usually be found diving up sand dollars and sea biscuits or trying not to take a dive off a ski slope in Colorado. In addition to diving and skiing, Lisa loves spending time with her husband and kids, running, hiking, finding the perfect word, side hustling as an interior designer, and art and art history.

Alexandra is best known professionally as Co-Founder of ecommerce sensation, Gilt, which transformed the landscape of luxury and fashion with the flash sale, creating urgency of demand and innovating online shopping. Alexandra owned the Chief Merchant role at Gilt, and filled many other seats on the journey from start-up to $650M in revenues. Having learned how to parlay the ability to sell accessible luxury items into selling travel and experiences, Alexandra became intrigued by the idea of using technology to deliver services. As Co-Founder of GLAMSQUAD, Alexandra brought beauty services to the homes of the time constrained. Before AI and machine learning became household words, Alexandra worked on creating a shopping tool using these advanced technologies, ultimately acquired by Google pre-launch. While no one would have flinched if this pioneer in digital commerce, retail, merchandising, sales, business development and marketing had launched another start-up, Alexandra joined Allergan, the global pharmaceutical leader in aesthetics, to help them learn how to communicate directly with consumers. Don’t hold it against Alexandra that she is a double H – Harvard B.A. and MBA. Alexandra’s humility is disarming, especially when she speaks to you in your native language (of which she speaks five). Alexandra is a relentless consumer, forever testing new platforms and products. She will often have suggestions on a first meeting. When she is not analyzing a new consumer concept, Alexandra can be found on the tennis court, not missing her New York roots as she soaks up sunshine with her husband and two kids in their Florida digs.

Susie’s ability to recognize innovative founders disrupting their industries is more than a passion, it’s her DNA. After several years analyzing big public equities at Bank of America and Putnam Investments, Susie turned in her subscription to Bloomberg for Pitchbook and joined the renowned platform builder Yellow Wood Partners. Susie learned from the best what it takes to execute, integrate, and grow. After working on several deals and a notable exit, Susie decided to move down the cap table to invest in earlier stage companies. She joined Volition Capital to help the team  expand beyond traditional SaaS businesses to internet & consumer companies. Most recently, prior to joining Clerisy, Susie really “hit her stride” in the beauty and personal care space as a founding member of the team at Stride Consumer Partners, a middle market consumer-focused growth equity firm. Having now worked across all stages of business evolution, Susie brings her discerning eye and deep experience to Clerisy to help uncover the next big thing in consumer and consumer tech. We won’t wager money on Susie’s regional origins. She may have spent some time in the DC melting pot while studying Finance, Accounting and Economics at Georgetown, as well as a few years cutting her teeth in NYC, but it only takes one conversation to identify this Bostonian. They say birds of a feather flock together, which may explain her husband being a Hoya, but she really took it to heart and also married a fellow consumer analyst. While Susie used to travel the world seeking outdoor adventures, with two young kids and an unusually needy cat, these days, Susie can be found running along the Charles River and traveling wherever a car seat and stroller can take her.

Let Food Dive’s free newsletter keep you informed, straight from your inbox.

The prebiotic soda offering is the top non-alcoholic brand in the U.S. by dollar sales and unit growth, according to the company.

Olipop, valued at just $200 million in 2022, has seen its valuation soar as consumers look for more in the products they drink.

Olipop is the top single-serve, non-alcoholic beverage manufacturer in dollar and unit growth, the company said, citing data from Circana and SPINS. Roughly half of its growth is from legacy carbonated soft drinks such as Pepsi and Coke, with the rest coming from new shoppers entering the category and current soda drinkers adding Olipop to their carts.

“It’s staggering and thrilling to have achieved a $1.85B valuation after just five to six short years in market,” Ben Goodwin, Olipop’s co-founder and CEO, said in a statement, adding it’s “a testament to the innovation breakthroughs and momentum we have demonstrated as the founders of the modern soda category.”

Olipop turned profitable in 2024, with s ales doubling to $400 million year-over-year, according to the company. Goodwin told Bloomberg the latest funding round will advance innovation and help the brand enter into more retailers.

Olipop is best known for its refrigerated sodas available in flavors like Cherry Vanilla, Banana Cream, Watermelon Lime and Vintage Cola. The company recently added a shelf-stable offering to its lineup, giving the functional beverage more space at retailers and enabling it to attract new consumers. Olipop reaches nearly 20% of U.S. households, the company said, providing it with a significant opportunity for growth.

The functional soda is sold at close to 50,000 grocers including Walmart, Target, Whole Foods, Kroger, Costco and Starbucks.

Olipop has positioned the brand as a healthier alternative to sugar-laden soda with 5 grams of the sweetener and fewer than 50 calories. The drink also contains prebiotic fiber that comes from chicory root, cassava root and Jerusalem artichoke to promote gut health.

The presence of J.P. Morgan in the latest funding round will help promote the brand among investors and further its position as a profitable business. Olipop already has a lengthy list of celebrity investors, including the Jonas Brothers, Mindy Kaling and Gwyneth Paltrow, plus former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi.

Goodwin told Bloomberg this will be the company’s last round of funding, but he hasn’t determined if he wants to take the company public or sell it to a larger entity.

In addition to the latest funding round, Olipop appointed Mel Landis as its new president.

Landis, with more than 36 years of experience at business giants such as Coca-Cola and Kraft, will play a key role in growing the beverage maker. Landis is undoubtedly familiar with consumer trends and consumption habits, especially when it comes to sugary carbonated drinks.

The US and UK’s leading independent non-alcoholic ‘spirit’ brand, CleanCo, has been given a redesign and new recipe to bring it down to 0.0% ABV.

Formerly known as the Clean Liquor Company, Spencer Matthews (of Made in Chelsea fame) launched the brand in 2019 to tap into a gap in the market for non-alcoholic alternatives to spirits. The line was initially launched in the UK with an ABV of 1.2% and was brought down to 0.4% several years later.

The brand is now officially alcohol-free after transitioning to 0.0% ABV, at the same time as unveiling a new lighter bottle that uses 50% less energy.

The CleanCo collection includes alternatives for gin, rum, whiskey, vodka and Tequila .

The move to zero-ABV was to ensure the range was “as inclusive as possible” and to avoid confusion for consumers, Matthews explained.

Matthews noted that while the range at 0.4% ABV was “essentially the same amount of naturally occurring alcohol you’d find in a banana”, it was found to be confusing for consumers after “extensive testing”.

He called the new recipes a “natural evolution for the brand and the category”.

Produced in the UK, the new liquids continue to be sugar free, contain less than 10 calories per double measure, and are made using all-natural flavourings.

The new design was created in partnership with design agency Knockout.

The brand has retained its hexagonal shape but the glass bottle is now lighter, requiring half the energy it previously used.

More bottles of CleanCo can now fit into each shipping container and each truck, which equates to two fewer trips across the Atlantic and 40 fewer trucks on the road each year, reducing the brand’s carbon footprint by more than 12,000 miles.

“We’re looking to be on a more sustainable path,” Matthews said of the new design. “We were the second ever non-alcoholic ‘spirit’ brand to hit the market, after Seedlip. And so there wasn’t really the necessity for competitive shelf standout. We’re constantly growing and developing the brand, but we just wanted to make it beautiful, available, and accessible to everyone.”

Matthews recently achieved a Guinness World Record after completing 30 marathons in 30 days through the Jordanian desert.

“We’d like to grow our clean running community,” said Matthews, who is planning a CleanCo half-marathon in October, where participants will be encouraged to enjoy alcohol-free serves in pubs along the way.

“From a personal perspective, I’ve been very unhealthy and very healthy, and having a much better relationship with alcohol has been, for me, the biggest changing factor in my life and it’s allowed me to do all kinds of things, like really push to try and achieve my full potential on a personal level and and actually feel proud of myself.”

Matthews hopes that the products will help to change lives and encourage drinkers to moderate their alcohol consumption.

Leading brand in UK and US

According to Nielsen data for the year ending 20 July 2024, CleanCo was the number-one independent non-alcoholic ‘spirit’ brand in the US off-premise, and the country’s second fastest-growing brand in the category.

In the UK, it is the leading independent non-alcoholic ‘spirit’ brand in the off-trade, based on Nielsen data for the year to 15 June 2024.

The company teamed up with Jim Clerkin’s brand-building firm, Demeter & Co, to launch in the States in October 2021.

Through a partnership with the nation’s leading distributor, Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits, CleanCo has been available in more than 5,300 distribution points across 40 states since August 2024.

In 2023 alone, CleanCo claims to have sold a Clean cocktail every eight seconds through its global network of retailers, bars and restaurants. The company states that its growth rate is now double that of the category.

CleanCo previously secured a £7 million (US$8.9m) investment in 2020 to help it become the number-one brand in the low- and no-alcohol category.

The newly designed range will be available from supermarkets and online from the brand’s website from 1 October 2024, with a price-tag of £16 (US$21) in the UK. The products have a shelf life of two years.

InsideGOLF: +$140 Value

Scottie Scheffler uses the GolfForever Swing Trainer to keep his game sharp. Here's how to get one of your own.

Courtesy of Golf Forever

No one in men’s golf is on a heater right now quite like Scottie Scheffler. He’s won in four of his last five starts and nabbed a green jacket in the process. Couple that with his wins at the Arnold Palmer, Players Championship and RBC Heritage, and you’ve got quite the impressive stretch.

Scheffler has never been one to get too complicated with his process. He’s never bogged down in TrackMan data or obsessing over his technique. He’s used the same swing instructor since he was a kid ( GOLF Hall-of-Fame Teacher Randy Smith) and he’s been known to use a grip trainer on the range to nail his fundamentals.

That simplicity can also be seen in how he preps for his rounds — both on the day of competition and in the lead up. With the grind that is professional golf, it’s important to keep your body in optimal shape. And for help with that, Scheffler turns to the GolfForever Swing Trainer.

“I’m training myself in the gym on how to move properly on the course,” Scheffler has said. “And, when I’m out there (over golf shots), I don’t have to think as much to swing the way I need to swing.”

The GolfForever Swing Trainer has helped Scheffler add more power, stability and mobility to his game. And it’s an integral part of his warm-up routine, too.

This training aid is a first-of-its-kind product that can be used both as an at-home workout tool and pre-round warm-up aid. It builds strength, mobility, speed and consistency in your swing. And if it’s trusted by the best in the world, it’s safe to say it works.
