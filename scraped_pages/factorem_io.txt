The WijiBoard – Build, Learn, or Pre-Built Choose your experience:

Whether you want to build it yourself or skip straight to using it, the WijiBoard offers creativity, engineering, and fun in one package!

This comprehensive course takes you through every aspect of building your own WijiBoard, from the fundamentals of electronics to creating a custom PCB, programming in multiple languages, and mechanical design with 3D CAD models. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced maker, this course is packed with insights and practical knowledge that will help you create a unique, functional WijiBoard.

Electronics: From Basics to Custom PCB Design

Start with the fundamentals of electronics and progress to designing and building your own custom printed circuit board (PCB). We’ll cover everything from wiring to circuit components, giving you the knowledge to bring your WijiBoard to life.

Programming with C++, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

You’ll learn to program the WijiBoard using a variety of languages, including C++, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS—all within VS Code and PlatformIO. This course teaches you not just how to code, but how to bring everything together into a cohesive, functional project.

Mechanical Design with 3D CAD Models

I provide all the 3D CAD models needed for the WijiBoard build. You’ll learn how to navigate and use these models to customize the design, ensuring that your board is both aesthetically pleasing and fully functional.

In Depth Design Documents (~150 pages)

This detailed guide walks you through the entire build spanning approximately 150 pages

3 Hours of Video Content

In addition to the written instructions, you’ll have access to 3 hours of video tutorials, where I walk you through the build process, show key assembly steps, and offer troubleshooting tips

Complete Source Files

All source files are included: C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Fusion 360 3D models, KiCAD PCB files—everything you need to build and modify your WijiBoard

Encouragement to Customize & Innovate

This project is more than just following instructions—it's about making it your own. You’re encouraged to update and modify the WijiBoard in creative and interesting ways, using the provided files and knowledge to push the boundaries of what you can create

Access to Exclusive Discord Server

Join our vibrant community of WijiBoard builders! You’ll gain access to a dedicated Discord server where you can share your setup, compare use cases, exchange spooky videos, and get support from fellow creators and me

This course took a significant amount of time and effort to create, and I’ve worked hard to condense complex concepts into something that is both palatable and valuable . I’ve decided to charge for this course to:

That said, I strongly believe that high-level education should be accessible to everyone, not just those who can afford it. For that reason, this course is also available for free to anyone who wants it.

To access the course for free, simply provide your email address below, and you’ll be added to a queue. Periodically, I will admit small cohorts from this queue. This will be done blindly , so "paid" members won’t know who the "free" members are.

I limit admissions to cohorts to ensure that I can offer the same level of support to everyone. Those who provide a bit of information and show genuine enthusiasm for taking the course will be prioritized over generic submissions like, "Free plz. LOL" (Yes, that has happened).

I’m asking you to pay if you can afford it and to be patient if you can’t. All I ask in return, if you get the course for free, is that you commit to it , share your progress and curiosity with others, and be an active, valuable member of the community.

Nerd-Sniped

This is a designed from scratch chess set, roll-up board and carrying case. The carrying case holds all the pieces for quick and easy transport, and when the case is fully assembled with the board, it looks like a huge rook! This makes it a great display and conversation piece, and since everything is plastic, the game can easily be played indoors or out.

Quick Video of it in action!:

Printing

Being that the rook case is really big (it's a little over 16" tall when assembled), it does take a bit to fully print everything but all pieces were designed so they can be printed on standard i3 buildplates. The chess pieces and board tiles can be printed on much smaller printers, but the base and top files ("1b-rook-top" and "1b-base") will need Prusa sized buildplates or larger.

The base and top of the rook take the longest to print (the base takes about a day). All in, this will take 3-5 days of straight printing with a single printer depending on your buildplate and print settings. With fairly light print settings (low infill), this will need about a single 1kg roll of white filament and two 1kg rolls of black filament (or whatever colors you want!)

Assembly

The assembly of this is pretty straight forward, and it was designed so that parts that shouldn't go together won't go together. The only issues that could happen would be gluing things together too quickly, or reversing the colors of tiles.

Nerd-Sniped

This is a designed from scratch dominoes set and carrying case.  The carrying case holds all the pieces to a standard "double six" dominoes set of 28 tiles in total.  This makes a great display and conversation piece (just like our giant chess set!).  Everything is 3D printed which makes pieces super easy to replace if they are lost or damaged.

The pieces are 2" x 1" which is the "professional" size, the large carrying case maintains the exact same aspect ratio measuring 8"x 4".

Printing

Everything including the case should fit on a standard Prusa i3 or ender3 buildplate, since all the parts share a coordinate system they should scale up or down nicely too if you want a slightly different size.  All told there is ~24 hours of total printing time making this a perfect weekend project.

You will need one of each Domino, 169 small pips, 28 dashes, 1 top, 1 bottom, 7 large pips and 1 big dash to complete the assembly.

Assembly

There isnt too much assembly here, I opted to superglue the Pips and dashes into their final position, it takes about an hour to do all ~169 pips and 28 dashes with a fine tiped super glue.

Ever wondered what DND dice would look like as weapons? This project turns each die into a prop shaped like the weapon it represents.  Fun to print, more fun to hold

This is an adapter that allows the EMEO digital instrument to be wirelessly charged using Mag-Safe Technology. The adapter acts as a convenient vertical stand!

These are the Digital Files necessary to print the parts if you have a 3D printer. Finished Physical Parts are available as well.

In addition to this 3D print, there are a few more items to purchase (Mag-Safe charger, charging pad, and USB-C adapter) The additional items are approximately $35 on amazon
