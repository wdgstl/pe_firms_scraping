What sets GTMfund apart is their execution. The responsiveness and support is incredible – GTMfund is the real deal. They walk the walk on supporting founders. I couldn’t recommend GTMfund enough. They’re my first call for anything GTM and always will be.

For 2 founders with product and engineering backgrounds - the GTMfund team have been super helpful as we build our sales muscle. Appreciate the support!

You guys added a ton of value to us as a company (and picked a winner :) ) … so much value that Weston and I both joined as LPs. Not sure there’s a stronger endorsement than that!
