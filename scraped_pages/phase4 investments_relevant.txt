That said, PHASE4 has an investment philosophy and formula, all our own. One that is purpose-driven, and values-based.

PHASE4 Investments partners with purpose-driven startups and small companies (5-50 employees), using a structured formula to investment criteria, use-of-proceeds, and operating model.

By comparison, we like to position ourselves as a hybrid of venture capital, private equity and angel investors (frankly, we take a "best-of-all-three" approach). In addition, think of us as a blend of business incubator meets accelerator (but without the dot-com era hype and hyperbole), combined with the television shows "Shark Tank" and "The Profit" (minus the fanfare and cameras).
